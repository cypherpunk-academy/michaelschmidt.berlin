She notices that she gets tired when she walks around the city and sees adverts and other things. She feels that it is expected, that there is pressure on her, that she should decorate her home in a different way or that she should look different. If you could say something about why she gets tired when she sees many things when her car is running.\nIris What you are reacting to or what you are getting tired of is that all the advertising that is around you, everything that is product oriented and that is reinforced with light, with colours, with sounds, movements and so on. It tires our senses, because we can\u0026rsquo;t help but take it in and it\u0026rsquo;s done so that we can\u0026rsquo;t help but take it in. It is so cunningly done that it is not supposed to enter your conscious plane. On your conscious level, you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to just be affected and reject, dislike or like, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter. It\u0026rsquo;s just that you react, because then an etching is created, one would say for, but it becomes like a tattoo inside. When you come into a shop and go shopping and you see a brand that you have been tattooed with, you will draw us to it to buy that particular brand. And it is, what did I say, we become adapted to it in a certain month and all adaptation in one way or another becomes a weariness, an indifference, a sorry.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-advertisment-and-tiredness-03-21/","tags":["advertising","shopping","fatigue","customisation","grief"],"title":"Iris, why do I get so tired of watching adverts and shopping?"},{"categories":["Garden of Epicurus"],"contents":"Question In the introduction you said that you occasionally look at the atmosphere and read. How does this work over Zoom?\nIris Just like if we are one metre apart or if someone is in Australia when I am in Sweden. The atmosphere has no distance. It is here and now and present all the time. The darkness of the universe, there is no distance. And there\u0026rsquo;s no time and space either, it\u0026rsquo;s just here and now and present. All the information from humanity\u0026rsquo;s infancy to its demise is in the atmosphere. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s from other planets as well, but that\u0026rsquo;s not my language so I can\u0026rsquo;t do that. It is a knowledge. It\u0026rsquo;s not that I see in the atmosphere, seeing is a sign of the situation. It\u0026rsquo;s just a knowledge that I call seeing so that it is somehow understandable and not some kind of mystical magic hocus pocus.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-reading-atmosphere-02-21/","tags":["Epicurus","the atmosphere","information","universe"],"title":"Iris, can you also see the atmosphere via Zoom?"},{"categories":["Garden of Epicurus"],"contents":"Question I have come across this phenomenon of people telling me that they used to be able to work all day and I wonder if it might be related to the third and fourth dimension of communication that this doesn\u0026rsquo;t really fit together anymore or what could it be related to?\nIris It has to do with our performance at a very high level and our adaptation. Exactly where you say that when you talk about energy, you talk about whether there was a certain amount of energy and that it should be distributed and that is partly a majority misunderstanding but it is also an adaptation. And in that moment you are afraid that your energy will not be enough, your body becomes afraid and then you do not have access to your energy. When you trust that you have a thousand times more energy than you will need, then the energy is in motion all the time and you feel that you have power. As soon as you think that there is only a certain amount and become afraid that it will not be enough and beat it. Then you can\u0026rsquo;t feel that you have any energy because you are standing still. And that is the reason why people become afraid and paralysed and do not have access to their power and unfortunately it becomes less and less. When we do not trust that we have a thousand times more power than we need, but believe that the power can run out, the fear comes earlier and earlier. which means that we do not have access to our excess energy. So it is preferable. If we then physically do everything that is necessary without being comfortable without really doing uncomfortable things all the time. then we get access to all the power, all the energy, because then the body is happily satisfied and we have as much power as we want. It\u0026rsquo;s about the same as if you\u0026rsquo;re cold, if you stay still and cut in because you think that if I just stay still and wear something I\u0026rsquo;ll be warm. Which, interestingly, then you get colder and colder. If instead you start running back and forth or playing and singing and hearing yourself, dancing and all sorts of things, and then step into the warmth. Then the heat stays there because the body radiates heat, which means that if you have a good hold, you keep the heat, for example, over the entire mat. If you have learnt that energy is created in this way, you will discover what enormous surplus energy you have even when you have worked all day for 20 hours or so as I do. We won\u0026rsquo;t talk about it now because it\u0026rsquo;s work, but still. There is too much on this side instead of that side so we have our faults and shortcomings. Balance is what matters.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-energy-to-work-02-21/","tags":["Epicurus","the atmosphere","information","universe"],"title":"Iris, did people have more energy to work in the past?"},{"categories":["The Garden of Epicurus"],"contents":"Question What does the atmosphere of a human being look like or what is everything in the atmosphere of a human being? Is there also his past, his future, so can he see that, himself, the human being himself?\nIris I can\u0026rsquo;t say that. When most people think of atmosphere, they think of energy or something, something material. There is dark matter and dark energy. And the two are a little less dark than the dark. So dark matter and dark energy exist as currents. But if they don\u0026rsquo;t move, then you don\u0026rsquo;t notice them. It\u0026rsquo;s like when you\u0026rsquo;re riding a bicycle and you have the wind behind you, but you\u0026rsquo;re riding so fast that you don\u0026rsquo;t notice the wind. But the dark has no matter and the sun can shine on it. It\u0026rsquo;s simple, yes, it\u0026rsquo;s just still dark. But it contains a lot of knowledge, not a lot of science, but a lot of knowledge, a lot of information. When I was little, I could sit on a swing and swing until I could turn out of matter and into the dark, into the immaterial. When I was there in the immaterial, I could see myself sitting on the swing and I could see myself as a hovering. And I was there with my immaterial friends Sliere and Sc√ºdde. That is the answer I can give to this question right now.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-athmosphere-of-human-being-02-21/","tags":["Epicurus","Dark matter","Dark Engerie","Atmosphere","Knowledge","Science"],"title":"Iris, what does a person's atmosphere look like?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hello, I am Alfred Mustermann\u0026hellip; As a creative UI/UX designer, I love to create beautiful designs that not only look stunning but also meet the needs of product users.
