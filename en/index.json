It is easy for me to see it in others. I have an example in your own field. You write that most cranks come from your own field. As I told you and noticed that it happens on people who like a lot of you. I am happy to find out what it is. All cranes like most cranes will improve. Indifference is the state of love, which is the natural one for us as humans.\nIris Love is a state that exists in the whole atmosphere and it exists all the time. It\u0026rsquo;s not a feeling, it\u0026rsquo;s a state. But it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to pull up to emotion as soon as you allow a mind to entertain itself in any way. Love, the state of love, when you raise it to an emotion, you become open and vulnerable. There are lots of different emotions inside a star. If it capsizes in one way or another, it turns into hate. It\u0026rsquo;s the other opposite on the same stick, on the same balance stick. It\u0026rsquo;s basically both love and hate and all the emotions that are within that spectrum when you pull up love to emotion. They have life force, it is the life force that generates it. And the other side, the other state, is indifference. When, for one reason or another, things stand in the way of letting in the state of love and living in all that the state of love attacks us with. When it is blocked for one reason or another, we end up in indifference.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-indifference-important-aspects-21-03/","tags":["Indifference","Love as a condition","Vitality","Hat"],"title":"Iris, why are we humans sometimes indifferent to very important things?"},{"categories":["The Garden of Epicurus"],"contents":"Question Yes, I have recently been dealing a lot with indifference as a phenomenon. So, I\u0026rsquo;m concerned with the fact that I observe that I, and also other people, simply remain cold in the face of quite significant things. Of course, it\u0026rsquo;s easier for me to see that in others. And I have an example in your book of misperceptions, you write that most illnesses come from misperceptions. And then I have often told this, mentioned it, and always noticed that yes, it passes, even with people who think very, very highly of you. And I would have liked to hear something about how it is that things like, for example, where most illnesses come more, just flow by.\nIris Love is a state that is there all the time in the atmosphere. And it\u0026rsquo;s quite easy to bring up this state to love, where one of my senses is amused, is amused by. The state, love, when you pull it up to feeling, you become open and vulnerable there. And all kinds of different sensations, feelings arise in oneself. If love then falls over in one way or another, then it becomes hate. And that is the other end, the other side of the same bridge, of the same branch. So all these sensations, all these feelings, love to hate, it is the life force that creates all these feelings. On the other hand, the other side of it is indifference. When something stands in the way, this state, and blocks this state of love. When love is not allowed to come upon us, so to speak, then indifference arises.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-indifference-important-aspects-03-21/","tags":["Indifference","Love as a state","Vitality","Hate"],"title":"Iris, why are we humans sometimes indifferent to very significant things?"},{"categories":["The Garden of Epicurus"],"contents":"Question And the other question is that I often notice that I\u0026rsquo;m very tired. I have to say that when I walk around in the city and see advertisements and things and then at some point I get a kind of tiredness, like, oh my God, I think it\u0026rsquo;s too much and in this buying society where we are, so I always get a feeling that I should now, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, look differently or take care of more stylish clothes or household and just, I don\u0026rsquo;t buy anything, but just even looking at that makes me very tired, if she can say something about this tiredness. So why do I get tired when I see a lot of things?\nIris The thing that you react to, the thing that makes you tired, is that when you\u0026rsquo;re out in the city, you see the colours, you see the movements, you hear the sounds and these advertisements are made in such a way that we can\u0026rsquo;t resist them, we have to take them in. The advertising is so cleverly made that it goes in and it\u0026rsquo;s the intention that through, through the advertising on a conscious level you either like that or you don\u0026rsquo;t like that or you, you get into an effect through it. The intention is that it should become like a tattoo on the inside. So when you go into a shop and you see this trademark that you\u0026rsquo;ve been tattooed with, then, it\u0026rsquo;s meant to make you feel attracted to this, to this trademark and that you should acquire that. It is, in a way, the intention that we should be adapted to that. And, and, and with all the adaptation there is a kind of weariness, a kind of sadness.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-advertisment-and-tiredness-03-21/","tags":["Advertising","Shopping","Fatigue","Adaptation","Mourning"],"title":"Iris, why do I get so tired of watching commercials and shopping?"},{"categories":["The Garden of Epicurus"],"contents":"Question Iris, in the introduction you said that you look into the atmosphere from time to time and read what you see there. How does that work via Zoom?\nIris It\u0026rsquo;s just like when we are there with a distance of one metre from each other, or if someone is in Australia and someone is in Sweden, with the atmosphere there is no distance. It is only here and now and present. In the darkness of the universe there is no distance, there is no time and space. There is only here and now and presence. All the information from the childhood of humanity to the demise of humanity is there in the atmosphere. There may also be information from other planets, but since I don\u0026rsquo;t speak that language, I don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about it. Yes, I call this seeing, but it is actually a knowing of it. I just call it seeing, so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be such a mumbo jumbo.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-reading-atmosphere-02-21/","tags":["Epicurus","Atmosphere","Information","Universe"],"title":"Iris, can you also see the atmosphere of a person via zoom?"},{"categories":["The Garden of Epicurus"],"contents":"Question I often encounter the phenomenon that people tell me that people used to have more energy. For example, they were able to work the whole day through, but today they have less. And I asked myself, is this perhaps connected to the third and fourth communication dimension, that something doesn\u0026rsquo;t really fit any more? Or what could that be?\nIris It\u0026rsquo;s largely connected with our imagination and with our adaptation. For example, when you talk about power or energy, you talk about it as if there were a certain amount of it. And that is a majority misunderstanding. The moment you get afraid that your energy will not be enough, you get afraid. And you don\u0026rsquo;t have access to the power. When you trust that you have a thousand times more power than you need, the energy is in constant movement. As soon as you get afraid that you won\u0026rsquo;t have enough energy, you get afraid and the power gets stuck. And that\u0026rsquo;s the reason why people slacken or have no more strength. So when we are in this thinking error, this diminishing strength comes sooner and sooner. And then we lack access to the power. That is the reason. If we then do everything that is necessary and uncomfortable immediately, the body becomes happy and satisfied. It\u0026rsquo;s like when you\u0026rsquo;re cold and you put something on. But you remain sitting or lying as still as possible, so that you can save as much strength as possible, so that you can warm yourself, then you don\u0026rsquo;t get warm. But if you start to dance or play the guitar and sing or run back and forth and then wrap yourself up, the warmth stays with you and you may stay warm all night. When you have discovered that, then you will see that you can work through it so easily, without any problems. And then Iris talks about her own work here. She can be active and working for 20 hours at a stretch, but then she says, we\u0026rsquo;re not talking about that now, because that\u0026rsquo;s working narcomania. That is too much on the other side and not too little on the other side. One has one\u0026rsquo;s faults and shortcomings. Balance or equilibrium is what matters.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-energy-to-work-02-21/","tags":["Prestanda och adaption","Energi och kraft","T√§nkfel","Role and activity","Balans och j√§mvikt"],"title":"Iris, did people have more energy to work in the past?"},{"categories":["The Garden of Epicurus"],"contents":"Question What does the atmosphere of a human being look like or what is everything in the atmosphere of a human being? Is there also his past, his future, so can he see that, himself, the human being himself?\nIris I can\u0026rsquo;t say that. When most people think of atmosphere, they think of energy or something, something material. There is dark matter and dark energy. And the two are a little less dark than the dark. So dark matter and dark energy exist as currents. But if they don\u0026rsquo;t move, then you don\u0026rsquo;t notice them. It\u0026rsquo;s like when you\u0026rsquo;re riding a bicycle and you have the wind behind you, but you\u0026rsquo;re riding so fast that you don\u0026rsquo;t notice the wind. But the dark has no matter and the sun can shine on it. It\u0026rsquo;s simple, yes, it\u0026rsquo;s just still dark. But it contains a lot of knowledge, not a lot of science, but a lot of knowledge, a lot of information. When I was little, I could sit on a swing and swing until I could turn out of matter and into the dark, into the immaterial. When I was there in the immaterial, I could see myself sitting on the swing and I could see myself as a hovering. And I was there with my immaterial friends Sliere and Sc√ºdde. That is the answer I can give to this question right now.\n","permalink":"https://lafisrap.github.io/en/blog/epikur-athmosphere-of-human-being-02-21/","tags":["Epicurus","Dark matter","Dark Engerie","Atmosphere","Knowledge","Science"],"title":"Iris, what does a person's atmosphere look like?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hello, I am Alfred Mustermann\u0026hellip; As a creative UI/UX designer, I love to create beautiful designs that not only look stunning but also meet the needs of product users.
