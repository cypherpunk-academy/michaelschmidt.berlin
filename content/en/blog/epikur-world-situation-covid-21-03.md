  We no longer look in the community that no one loses. It becomes an
  economising, a zero-sum game where what I get, someone else doesn't have. This
  creates emotional games, including the worst game, war. We are radicalised
  into it by becoming afraid.

###### Question
Yes, the question is about the world situation or how Iris thinks we can relate to it.
Since the beginning of the Corona pandemic, I think it's become more and more clear to me that something that is being conveyed,
is more and more out of touch with reality.
On Saturday, I went to a demonstration here in Stockholm for the first time.
And I went there in the name of democracy, which even in Sweden is not slightly windy, I don't know if you say it in German like that,
but quite simply damaged now by a law, where you are allowed to assemble at most eight people, to assemble, eight.
And yes, after a few hours, I was filmed and after a few hours 400, 500 people had written on Facebook what a lunatic I was,
that I'm threatening other people's lives because of my existence and stuff. And that raises a lot of questions.

###### Iris
I have almost finished editing a booklet on secondary life today and in that booklet there is a detailed answer to your question.
The title is Together in Conversation about Secondary Life.
But I will still give you an answer now because the question is a very interesting question.
When we talk about reality, we mean everything that can be taken as an object, that can be made into a thing.
With this one, we have created a zero-sum game.
We have created an economisation of it.
And in contrast to the primary, this is secondary, elementary and selectable.
People, can dispose of this.
They can direct this.
Because this is a game, there are, and there are rules to the game, there are winners and losers.
If somebody wins, there is somebody else who loses.
And I believe that it is this game that you suspect, and this game quite rightly endangers democracy as well, as you have this hunch.
It builds on an inhuman way of thinking.
And I believe it is this that creates a discomfort in you.
To understand this, you need to know that our consciousness is basically a protection and defence mechanism for survival.
And we have been given this prerequisite, because in wild nature we have few other prerequisites for survival.
Our senses are not sharp enough. We don't see enough, we don't hear enough.
We don't sense scents accurately enough to cope in wild nature.
We need the help of others for quite a long time until we are ready to do something about it or to do it ourselves.
And even when we have grown up, we still run too slowly or we don't fight well and we easily fall prey to wild animals.
And that's why we got a consciousness and a speech organ, so that we can communicate with others.
And we need to be part of a herd.
What is it then that characterises the human being?
When you are in a group with others in the wild, you make sure that no one loses out.
It is what characterises or distinguishes primitive peoples.
It is that the people in the group take care of each other in such a way that nobody loses.
It is this that creates a sustainable herd for people.
Then when we have organised the community, the society in such a way that there are no external dangers and we use our consciousness to operate our intellect and we make use of our consciousness.
Going there, we don't need that consciousness to live in the herd anymore, but we instead then make use of our consciousness in an inhuman way.
And I think that this is what is squeaking inside you.
A system that has become economised is an inhuman system and it becomes an emotional game.
And the worst of the emotional games that take place in our world are the wars.
And that game is to scare a human being to the point that he becomes inhuman without that human being knowing that he is scared.
That is what radicalisation is.
I think that this is what is rubbing inside you, even if you haven't put it into words like that, but you can think about it.

###### Question
You mean that I am radicalised in a way?

###### Iris
Not that you are being radicalised, rather that you are being threatened by the radicalisation that is taking place in society.
Unfortunately, you are also right in that we all get radicalised when we get scared.
So we are not free of it either.
