title: Iris, why do I get so tired of watching adverts and shopping?

  Advertising intends to tattoo us on the inside. Then when we see a brand in
  the shop that we are tattooed with, we feel attracted to it. The intention is
  to make us adapt to it, and in the process, fatigue and a kind of sadness
  arises.

###### Question
MÃ¤rja gets very tired.
She notices that she gets tired when she walks around the city and sees adverts and other things.
She feels that it is expected, that there is pressure on her, that she should decorate her home in a different way or that she should look different.
If you could say something about why she gets tired when she sees many things when her car is running.

###### Iris
What you are reacting to or what you are getting tired of is that all the advertising that is around you, everything that is product oriented and that is reinforced with light, with colours,
with sounds, movements and so on. It tires our senses, because we can't help but take it in and it's done so that we can't help but take it in.
It is so cunningly done that it is not supposed to enter your conscious plane. On your conscious level, you're supposed to just be affected and reject, dislike or like, it doesn't matter.
It's just that you react, because then an etching is created, one would say for, but it becomes like a tattoo inside.
When you come into a shop and go shopping and you see a brand that you have been tattooed with, you will draw us to it to buy that particular brand.
And it is, what did I say, we become adapted to it in a certain month and all adaptation in one way or another becomes a weariness, an indifference, a sorry.
