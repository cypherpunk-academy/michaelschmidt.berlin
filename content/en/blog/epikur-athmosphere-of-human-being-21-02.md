###### Question
What does the atmosphere of a human being look like or what is everything in the atmosphere of a human being? Is there also his past, his future, so can he see that, himself, the human being himself?

###### Iris
I can't say that. When most people think of atmosphere, they think of energy or something, something material. There is dark matter and dark energy. And the two are a little less dark than the dark. So dark matter and dark energy exist as currents. But if they don't move, then you don't notice them. It's like when you're riding a bicycle and you have the wind behind you, but you're riding so fast that you don't notice the wind. But the dark has no matter and the sun can shine on it. It's simple, yes, it's just still dark. But it contains a lot of knowledge, not a lot of science, but a lot of knowledge, a lot of information. When I was little, I could sit on a swing and swing until I could turn out of matter and into the dark, into the immaterial. When I was there in the immaterial, I could see myself sitting on the swing and I could see myself as a hovering. And I was there with my immaterial friends Sliere and Sc√ºdde. That is the answer I can give to this question right now.
