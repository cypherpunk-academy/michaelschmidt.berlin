title: "Filip: How does life sound?"

description: >
  Filip makes music and translates Iris into German and English... and
  accompanies her on journeys and at home. His great discovery is the sound
  couch, a monochord, on which he plays for and into people - since the Corona
  time also via Zoom (the "atmosphere" knows no space). 40 minutes on the couch
  can be relaxing, liberating, eventful or life-changing, depending on... yes...
  as the moment is and the mutuality. Sometimes there are sound evenings with a
  big sound couch and some small ones to put on the belly or back, and
  participants play for each other. He also translates courses and individual
  meetings and books by Iris.
