  The atmosphere contains present information from humanity's infancy to
  destruction, which is a universal knowledge without distance or time and
  space, which can be perceived as seeing to make it understandable and not
  mysterious.

###### Question
In the introduction you said that you occasionally look at the atmosphere and read. How does this work over Zoom?

###### Iris
Just like if we are one metre apart or if someone is in Australia when I am in Sweden. The atmosphere has no distance. It is here and now and present all the time. The darkness of the universe, there is no distance. And there's no time and space either, it's just here and now and present. All the information from humanity's infancy to its demise is in the atmosphere. Maybe it's from other planets as well, but that's not my language so I can't do that. It is a knowledge. It's not that I see in the atmosphere, seeing is a sign of the situation. It's just a knowledge that I call seeing so that it is somehow understandable and not some kind of mystical magic hocus pocus.
