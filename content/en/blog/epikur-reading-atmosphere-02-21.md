  The atmosphere knows no distance and is timeless and spaceless, containing
  information from childhood to the demise of humanity and possibly from other
  planets, which is called seeing but is actually a knowing.

###### Question
Iris, in the introduction you said that you look into the atmosphere from time to time and read what you see there. How does that work via Zoom?

###### Iris
It's just like when we are there with a distance of one metre from each other, or if someone is in Australia and someone is in Sweden, with the atmosphere there is no distance. It is only here and now and present. In the darkness of the universe there is no distance, there is no time and space. There is only here and now and presence. All the information from the childhood of humanity to the demise of humanity is there in the atmosphere. There may also be information from other planets, but since I don't speak that language, I don't know anything about it. Yes, I call this seeing, but it is actually a knowing of it. I just call it seeing, so it doesn't seem to be such a mumbo jumbo.
