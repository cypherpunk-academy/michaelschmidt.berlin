  The lack of energy and power that people often talk about is related to an
  error in thinking that leads to fear and thus losing access to power, but if
  you learn to trust that you have enough energy, you can do your work without
  any problems. (Chat GPT)

###### Question
I have come across this phenomenon of people telling me that they used to be able to work all day and I wonder if it might be related to the third and fourth dimension of communication that this doesn't really fit together anymore or what could it be related to?

It has to do with our performance at a very high level and our adaptation. Exactly where you say that when you talk about energy, you talk about whether there was a certain amount of energy and that it should be distributed and that is partly a majority misunderstanding but it is also an adaptation.
And in that moment you are afraid that your energy will not be enough, your body becomes afraid and then you do not have access to your energy.
When you trust that you have a thousand times more energy than you will need, then the energy is in motion all the time and you feel that you have power.
As soon as you think that there is only a certain amount and become afraid that it will not be enough and beat it. Then you can't feel that you have any energy because you are standing still.
And that is the reason why people become afraid and paralysed and do not have access to their power and unfortunately it becomes less and less.
When we do not trust that we have a thousand times more power than we need, but believe that the power can run out, the fear comes earlier and earlier.
which means that we do not have access to our excess energy. So it is preferable.
If we then physically do everything that is necessary without being comfortable without really doing uncomfortable things all the time.
then we get access to all the power, all the energy, because then the body is happily satisfied and we have as much power as we want.
It's about the same as if you're cold, if you stay still and cut in because you think that if I just stay still and wear something I'll be warm.
Which, interestingly, then you get colder and colder.
If instead you start running back and forth or playing and singing and hearing yourself, dancing and all sorts of things, and then step into the warmth.
Then the heat stays there because the body radiates heat, which means that if you have a good hold, you keep the heat, for example, over the entire mat.
If you have learnt that energy is created in this way, you will discover what enormous surplus energy you have even when you have worked all day for 20 hours or so as I do.
We won't talk about it now because it's work, but still.
There is too much on this side instead of that side so we have our faults and shortcomings.
Balance is what matters.
