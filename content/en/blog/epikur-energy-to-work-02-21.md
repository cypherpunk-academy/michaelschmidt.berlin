  The lack of energy and strength that people often talk about is related to a
  thinking error that leads to getting scared and thus losing access to
  strength, but if you learn to trust that you have enough energy, you can go
  through your work without any problems.

###### Question
I often encounter the phenomenon that people tell me that people used to have more energy.
For example, they were able to work the whole day through, but today they have less.
And I asked myself, is this perhaps connected to the third and fourth communication dimension, that something doesn't really fit any more?
Or what could that be?

###### Iris
It's largely connected with our imagination and with our adaptation.
For example, when you talk about power or energy, you talk about it as if there were a certain amount of it.
And that is a majority misunderstanding.
The moment you get afraid that your energy will not be enough, you get afraid.
And you don't have access to the power.
When you trust that you have a thousand times more power than you need, the energy is in constant movement.
As soon as you get afraid that you won't have enough energy, you get afraid and the power gets stuck.
And that's the reason why people slacken or have no more strength.
So when we are in this thinking error, this diminishing strength comes sooner and sooner.
And then we lack access to the power.
That is the reason.
If we then do everything that is necessary and uncomfortable immediately, the body becomes happy and satisfied.
It's like when you're cold and you put something on.
But you remain sitting or lying as still as possible, so that you can save as much strength as possible, so that you can warm yourself, then you don't get warm.
But if you start to dance or play the guitar and sing or run back and forth and then wrap yourself up, the warmth stays with you and you may stay warm all night.
When you have discovered that, then you will see that you can work through it so easily, without any problems.
And then Iris talks about her own work here.
She can be active and working for 20 hours at a stretch, but then she says, we're not talking about that now, because that's working narcomania.
That is too much on the other side and not too little on the other side.
One has one's faults and shortcomings.
Balance or equilibrium is what matters.
