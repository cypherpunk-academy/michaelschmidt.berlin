description: >
  Love is a state that is present in the atmosphere all the time and can easily
  be pulled up by a feeling of joy and amusement. It is a state of openness and
  vulnerability that brings up different sensations and feelings in us, which
  can also sometimes "fall over" and become hate. However, when love is blocked
  due to obstacles, it can turn into indifference.

###### Question
Yes, I have recently been dealing a lot with indifference as a phenomenon.
So, I'm concerned with the fact that I observe that I, and also other people,
simply remain cold in the face of quite significant things.
Of course, it's easier for me to see that in others.
And I have an example in your book of misperceptions, you write that most illnesses come from misperceptions.
And then I have often told this, mentioned it, and always noticed that yes, it passes, even with people who think very, very highly of you.
And I would have liked to hear something about how it is that things like, for example,
where most illnesses come more, just flow by.

###### Iris
Love is a state that is there all the time in the atmosphere.
And it's quite easy to bring up this state to love, where one of my senses is amused, is amused by.
The state, love, when you pull it up to feeling, you become open and vulnerable there.
And all kinds of different sensations, feelings arise in oneself.
If love then falls over in one way or another, then it becomes hate.
And that is the other end, the other side of the same bridge, of the same branch.
So all these sensations, all these feelings, love to hate, it is the life force that creates all these feelings.
On the other hand, the other side of it is indifference.
When something stands in the way, this state, and blocks this state of love.
When love is not allowed to come upon us, so to speak, then indifference arises.
