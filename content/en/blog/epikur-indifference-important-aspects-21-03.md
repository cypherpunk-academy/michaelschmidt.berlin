  Love is a state that is in the atmosphere all the time and can easily be
  pulled up by a sense of joy and entertainment. It is a state of openness and
  vulnerability that evokes various emotions and sensations in us, which can
  also sometimes "fall over" and become hatred. But when love is blocked by
  obstacles, it can turn into indifference.

###### Question
For some time now I have been struggling with the phenomenon of indifference, where people are indifferent and unaffected by a phenomenon.
It is easy for me to see it in others.
I have an example in your own field.
You write that most cranks come from your own field.
As I told you and noticed that it happens on people who like a lot of you.
I am happy to find out what it is.
All cranes like most cranes will improve.
Indifference is the state of love, which is the natural one for us as humans.

###### Iris
Love is a state that exists in the whole atmosphere and it exists all the time.
It's not a feeling, it's a state.
But it's very easy to pull up to emotion as soon as you allow a mind to entertain itself in any way.
Love, the state of love, when you raise it to an emotion, you become open and vulnerable.
There are lots of different emotions inside a star.
If it capsizes in one way or another, it turns into hate.
It's the other opposite on the same stick, on the same balance stick.
It's basically both love and hate and all the emotions that are within that spectrum when you pull up love to emotion.
They have life force, it is the life force that generates it.
And the other side, the other state, is indifference.
When, for one reason or another, things stand in the way of letting in the state of love and living in all that the state of love attacks us with.
When it is blocked for one reason or another, we end up in indifference.
