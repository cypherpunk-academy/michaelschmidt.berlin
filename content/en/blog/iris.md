description: >
  Iris is autistic. And she gives communication courses... after learning to be
  a hairdresser in life, being married for 25 years, having a daughter, helping
  many drug addicts in their addiction or out of it, advising companies and
  schools, setting up the world's best children's retreat in √Ñngelsberg in
  Sweden, among other things with a "Garden of Epicurus". She speaks to people
  out of the "atmosphere", a world invisible to most of us, full of thoughts,
  images, currents, feelings, which surrounds us all and which as a child she
  called the "real world", as opposed to the ordinary one we all know. She is
  also a best-selling author, and, perhaps the most important reason why her
  communication courses are so exciting: She decided as a 12-year-old girl to
  learn everything there is to learn about communication. And she has done it
  with autistic meticulousness for over 50 years, every day since.
