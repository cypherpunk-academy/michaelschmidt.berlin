###### Question
What does a person's atmosphere look like? Does it contain information from his past, from his past and from his future? Is it the case that he himself has access to the information in his atmosphere?

###### Iris
Well, I can't know that, but when you think of the atmosphere, most people think of the atmosphere as energy or they think of the atmosphere as matter in some way. And there is dark energy, but it's not that dark. And it's a little less dark than the dark. And the energy and matter can form currents around us as humans. And it's kind of like the wind, when there's no wind, we don't think there's any wind. But if we have a headwind, we feel that it is blowing, but if we are travelling downwind, we do not feel that it is blowing until we stop. But the dark that is just dark, that is precisely what the film is, that it has no matter. That is why it is dark, even if the sun shines on it, it is dark. You can never see the darkness, it's there all the time, even when the sun is shining at its worst. But it contains a huge amount of science, but knowledge, it contains a lot of information. When I was little, I could sit on a swing and swing until I could twist myself out of the material and find myself in the dark, in the immaterial. When I was in the immaterial, I could see myself sitting on the swing and swinging and I could see myself as a shroud with my immaterial friends wearing and protecting. That's the answer I can give to that.
