##### WELCOME to a WEEKEND with PRIMARY WORK, PRIMARY PLAY
and 2 SOUND EVENTS.

This is a physical event at Turinerstr 21, 13347 Berlin. Germany. We have set up a playroom in our flat in Berlin and want to invite people for a long weekend where we can meet to explore what is going on inside us in the encounter with others.

There is space for 8 people in this room, and we also have another room with space for some people to sleep.
We have a big screen for the Zoom meetings and a good surround sound system for the sound evenings and there is also space to play games.

On the different themes of the weekend:

###### Original play and sharing about it with Benedicte and Michael:

The game rounds will take place in a safe room with soft mats, mattresses and pillows.
There will be some rules that will be explained at the beginning of the first round. These include not talking while playing and not going higher than your knees. There will also be a mattress or two, which is a free space where anyone can go if they need a break from playing and being played with. The rounds are limited in time.
After each round there will be a short exchange. Here everyone can say something about how the game was for him or her if he or she wants to. It is also possible to continue working with Iris in primary work in the afternoon.

It is difficult to describe the game without creating fixed images of it. But I will try, even at the risk of not succeeding.
Because play is always something you do freely. You can't force anyone or yourself to play.
For me, primary play is about finding the flow of life within me, impulses and what moves me in this moment, in this space, in the encounter with others and myself. What moves me and what stops me.
In play I have the opportunity to experience my blockages and what stops me and prevents me from moving or simply having fun. And I can feel my own needs and impulses and take care of them without adapting to others.
I think we were all in that state as little children before we learned how to behave.

PRIMARY GROUP WORK with Iris Johansson at Zoom:

Here are a few words about Primarywork written by Iris:
"It is individual work in a group. It means that everyone addresses a problem or difficulty or something that is inhibiting and limiting one's life in relation to oneself or in relation to partners or friends or family members of origin or in relation to work or work or illnesses such as stressful adjustments or other psychological difficulties, depression, allergies etc. etc. It could be that you have trauma from a past life, what is now called PTSD, or that you have anxieties that you don't understand about, etc. etc.... Anything that is a problem or that you want to know about, reflect on it in my perspective. Reflecting on it and/or working through it and processing it so that one's body has an aha moment and finds a new way to understand and see the problem and find new ways. (....)"
"Primary work and primary thought work is not therapy, it is about words that in one way or another have created beliefs that are in conflict with reality and where we try to reconcile reality with our beliefs rather than realising that reality applies. It is about the art of changing inside and making it your own, autonomous, until you discharge and are satisfied from within. Simple, but not easy, because we are imperfect and fallible, have talents and inabilities that mess everything up. That is why we need such inner work from time to time in life. (....)"

SOUNDEVENING with Filip Wall in Zoom:

Filip has a special talent and the music he plays has the ability to touch the autonomic nervous system. This system does not get caught up in this music, but enjoys its lightness and feels free to connect where the connection is broken and balance itself.
The instrument Filip plays is a monochord instrument with metal strings tuned in C-sharp and G-sharp and arranged in a flowing stream.
