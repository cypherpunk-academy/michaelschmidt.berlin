##### Welcome to a weekend of PRIMARY WORK, PRIMARY PLAY and 2 SOUND EVENTS.
and 2 SOUND EVENTS.

This is a physical event at Turinerstr 21, 13347 Berlin. Germany. We have set up a playroom in our apartment in Berlin and want to invite people to a long weekend where we can get together to explore what happens within us in the encounter with others.

There is space for 8 people in this room and we also have another room with space for some people to sleep.
We have a big screen for the Zoom meetings and a good surround sound system for the audio evenings and there is also space to play games.

On the different themes of the weekend:

###### Original games and sharing it with Benedicte and Michael:

The game rounds will take place in a safe room with soft carpets, mattresses and pillows.
There will be some rules that will be explained at the beginning of the first round. These include not talking while playing and not going higher than the knees. There will also be a mattress or two, which is a free space where anyone can go if they need a break from playing and being played with. The rounds are time-limited.
After each round, there will be a short exchange. Here everyone can say something about how the game was for him or her if he or she wants to. It is also possible to continue working with Iris in primary work in the afternoon.

It is difficult to describe the game without creating fixed images of it. But I will try, even if I risk not succeeding.
Because play is always something you do freely. You can't force someone or yourself to play.
For me, the primary play is about finding the flow of life within me, impulses and what moves me in this moment, in this room, in the encounter with others and myself. What moves me and what stops me.
In play, I have the opportunity to experience my blocks and what stops me and prevents me from moving or simply having fun. And I can feel my own needs and impulses and take care of them without adapting to others.
I think we were all in that state as young children before we learned how to behave.

PRIMARY GROUP WORK with Iris Johansson on Zoom:

Here are some words about Primarywork written by Iris:
"It is individual work in a group. It means that everyone brings up a problem or a difficulty or something that inhibits and limits one's life in relation to oneself or in relation to partners or friends or family members of origin or in relation to work or work or illnesses such as stress adaptations or other mental health difficulties, depression, allergies etc. etc. It may be that you have trauma from a previous life, what is now called PTSD, or that you have anxiety that you do not understand etc. etc. .... Anything that is a problem or that you want to know about, reflect on it from my perspective. Reflect on it and/or work through it and process it so that your body has an aha moment and finds a new way to understand and see the problem and find new ways (....)."
"Primary work and primary thought work is not therapy, it is about words that in one way or another have created beliefs that are in conflict with reality and where we try to reconcile reality with our beliefs rather than realising that reality is what matters. It is about the art of changing inside and making it your own, autonomously, until you are free and satisfied from within. Simple, but not easy, because we are imperfect and fallible, have talents and inabilities that mess up everything. This is why we need such inner work from time to time in life. (....)"

Audio recording with Filip Wall in Zoom:

Filip has a special talent and the music he plays has the ability to touch the autonomic nervous system. This system does not get stuck in this music, but enjoys its lightness and feels free to connect where the connection is broken and balance itself.
The instrument that Filip plays is a monochord instrument with metal strings tuned in C major and G major and arranged in a flowing stream.
