WELCOME to a WEEKEND with PRIMARYWORK, PRIMARY-PLAY
and 2 SOUNDEVENINGS.

This is a physical event in Turiner str 21, 13347 Berlin. Germany. We have created a Playing-room(Spielzimmer) in our flat in Berlin and want to invite people here for a long weekend were we can meet explore what is going on inside us in the meeting with others.(See images ).
There is place for 8 people to sleep in this room, and we also have one more room with place for some people to sleep.
We have a big screen for the Zoom meetings and a good surround sound-system for the sound-evenings and there is allso space for playing.

About the different topics of The weekend:

PRIMARYPLAY and SHARING with Benedicte and Michael:
The playing sessions will take place in a safe room with soft mats and mattresses and pillows. There will be some rules that will be explained in the beginning of the session. This includes not using words to communicate during the playing-session and also no walking higher then the knees during the time of playing. There will also be one or two mattresses that is a free-space where everyone can go if they need a pause or do not want to be played with. The sessions will happen within a time limit.
Afterwards there will be a short sharing-round. Here people can say something about how the playing was for them if they want. It is also possible process more with Iris in the Primarywork in the afternoon.
It is difficult to describe play without creating fixed images about it. But I will try, in the danger of failing.
Because play is always something you do freely It is not possible to force anyone or yourself to play.
For me, Primaryplay is about finding the life flow within, impulses and what moves me in this moment, in this space, in the meeting with others and my self. What moves me and what stops me.
In the playing I have the possibility experience my blocks and what stops me and hinders me from moving or just have fun. And I can feel my own needs and impulses and take care of them without adapting to others.
I guess we all have been in this state when we where small children before we learned how to behave.
PRIMARY GROUP WORK with Iris Johansson in Zoom:
This is some words about Primarywork that Iris has written:
"It is individual work in a group. It means that each one addresses what is a problem or a difficulty or something that inhibits and limits one's life in relation to oneself or in relation to partners or friends or family members of origin or with work or working or diseases such as straining adjustment or other mental difficulties, depression, allergies, etc., etc It could be that you have trauma from earlier in life, what is now called PTSD or that you have anxiety that you don't understand a bit about, etc., etc.... anything that is a problem or that you are curious to know something about, reflected in my perspective. To have it reflected and/or processed and processed so that your own body can have an aha experience and find a new way of understanding and seeing the problem, and find new paths. (....)"
"Primary work and primary thought work are not therapy but are about words that in one way or another have created beliefs that come into conflict with reality and where we try to make reality agree with our beliefs instead of realizing that reality applies. It's about the art of changing within oneself and making it one's own, autonomously, until you become uncharged and you are satisfied from within. Simple but not easy because we are imperfect and fallible, have talents and inabilities that mess with it all. Therefore, we may need such inner work from time to time in life. (....)"
SOUNDEVENING with Filip Wallin Zoom:
Filip has a special talent and the music that he plays has the ability to touch your autonomic nerve system. This system is not spellbound by this music but enjoys its ease and feels free to connect where there is disconnection and to balance itself.
The instrument Filip is playing is a monochord instrument with metal strings tuned in c-sharp and g-sharp arranged in a flowing stream.
