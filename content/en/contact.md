touches the top of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and only a few stray glimmers steal into the inner sanctum, I throw myself among the tall grass by the trickling stream, and as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are perceived by me.

Hearing the hum of the small world among the stalks and becoming familiar with the countless indescribable forms of insects and flies, I feel the presence of the Almighty who created us in His image and the breath of that universal love which sustains and sustains.
